                    <p><em>Hello!</em></p>
                    <p>My name is Isabella Cattalini, and I am currently studying to become a secondary school teacher, specialising in Technology and Applied Studies at <a href="https://www.acu.edu.au/" target="_blank">ACU</a>. Before stepping into teaching, I pursued my passion for fashion and design at UTS, studying a Bachelor of Fashion and Design for 1 year in 2022. This experience taught me the importance of creativity, problem-solving, and visual learning as powerful tools for expression. The decision to study teaching came from a combination of my design background and the influence of inspiring educators throughout my schooling, particularly my Year 12 Textiles teacher, whose encouragement and belief in me showed how impactful a dedicated teacher can be. My goal now is to combine my love for design with teaching, creating engaging and meaningful learning experiences that inspire students to see their own creative potential.</p>

                    <h2>ME ON A PERSONAL LEVEL</h2>
                    <p>Outside of my studies, I run <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bellistrated/?hl=en" target="_blank">Bellistrated</a>, my own design and illustration business, where I create custom artwork, stationery, and event pieces. I’ve always loved art, sewing, fashion, and all things design, and I enjoy bringing creativity into both my professional and personal life. When I’m not designing, I treasure spending time with family and friends, and I feel most at home when I’m around the water on sunny days. Creativity and connection are what drive me, and I try to live in a way that blends both into everything I do.</p>

                    <h2>MY MOTO</h2>
                    <p>This quote captures the essence of my philosophy as both a designer and a teacher. To me, design has never been just about creating something that looks good, it’s about problem-solving, functionality, and shaping meaningful experiences. In teaching, I see the same principle: my role is not only to help students create visually appealing work but to equip them with creative thinking skills that allow them to find solutions and adapt to challenges beyond the classroom. It is important to me because it reflects the lasting impact I want to have on my students’ futures, encouraging them to design not only for today but to contribute to the world they will one day lead and influence.</p>

                    <p>As part of my teaching degree at Australian Catholic University, I have undertaken 3 professional placements that were allocated by the university. Each placement was completed over a three-week period during my second and third year of study. These experiences gave me the opportunity to engage with diverse school communities, apply my developing skills in real classrooms, and refine my teaching practice under the guidance of experienced mentors.</p>

                    <H1>Campbeltown Performing Arts High School</H1>
                    <p>My first placement was at Campbelltown Performing Arts High School, where I taught Food Technology classes across Years 7–10. The school placed a strong emphasis on student wellbeing, with classrooms often focused on supporting students to overcome behavioural challenges through a complex range of strategies. I worked with students with diverse learning needs, including ADHD and other cognitive differences, which taught me the importance of personalised approaches and creating inclusive learning environments. This experience helped me develop greater confidence in differentiation, classroom management, and building positive relationships with students.</p>

                    <H1>Emmaus Catholic College</H1>
                    <p>My second placement was at Emmaus Catholic College, where I primarily taught Year 7 Textiles. Students were completing their end-of-year practical project, designing and creating plush toys, while also balancing their theory work and portfolio requirements. I developed a scaffolded schedule to support students in managing their time and meeting assessment outcomes, as well as designing learning templates that allowed them to experiment with new stitching skills and techniques. During practical lessons, I guided students through processes such as blanket stitch, basic stitch, long stitch, button sewing, and appliqué, ensuring they gained both technical proficiency and confidence in their creative work.</p>

                    <H1>Mary Mackillop Catholic College</H1>
                    <p>My most recent placement (2025) was at Mary MacKillop Catholic College, an all-girls school that provided me with a very different environment from my earlier experiences. The calmer classroom setting required me to adapt my teaching style and refine new approaches to suit the needs of the students. I taught Food Technology across Years 8–10, focusing primarily on theory-based lessons. This experience strengthened my ability to deliver engaging content without the support of practical lessons, encouraging me to use creative strategies to maintain student interest and ensure curriculum outcomes were met.</p>
