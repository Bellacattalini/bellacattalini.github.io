                    <p>My name is Isabella Cattalini, and I am currently completing my Bachelor of Education (Secondary)/Bachelor of Arts (Design Innovation and Technologies) at Australian Catholic University, specialising in Textiles & Design. With a background in fashion design and a passion for creativity, I aim to inspire students through visual and hands-on learning experiences. This portfolio is a reflection of my journey as a pre-service teacher, highlighting my teaching philosophy, professional placements, and the influences that have shaped me. Here, you’ll find insights into my practice, examples of my work, and reflections on the knowledge and skills I continue to develop as I prepare for a career in education.</p>
