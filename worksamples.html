            <h2>My Teaching Style and Influences</h2>
            <h3>First Year University Student Submission</h3>
            <p>Below is a presenation which underpins my Teaching Style and Influences from High School to current. It is a personal teaching statement which showacses my desire to become a TAS Teacher, hence, undertaking a  <strong> Bachelor of Arts in Design and Technology/Bachelor of Secondary Teaching </strong> degree. </p>

            <h4>Personal Teaching Statement </h4>
                <iframe width="680" height="383" src="media/personal_teaching_statement.mp4" title="Personal Teaching Statement" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            
                <p>My<strong>"Personal Teaching Statement"</strong>is grounded in creativity, visual learning, and the belief that design can shape how students see the world. Coming from a background in fashion design, I bring a strong emphasis on problem-solving, aesthetics, and innovation into the classroom. I encourage students to think critically, experiment with ideas, and express themselves visually, while also guiding them to connect their work with real-world applications. Reflecting on my practice so far, Iâ€™ve seen how engaging students through visual and creative approaches not only strengthens their understanding but also inspires confidence and curiosity in their own learning journey.</p>
